<h1 align="center">👋 Hi, I’m Dawid Garncarek</h1>
<h4 align="center">About me</h4>
<p align="center"> I am a young, ambitious computer scientist with a passion for continuously expanding my knowledge in this dynamic field. My interest in IT has been present for as long as I can remember, but it was during high school and later at university that I was able to deepen my understanding and consciously shape my technical profile. Studying computer science allowed me to build strong foundations, particularly in database management, while also gaining solid programming skills.</p>

<p align="center"> On the frontend side, I have experience working with Blazor, which I used to develop a web application for weight management. During this project, I also worked with Bootstrap 5 to create responsive and visually appealing user interfaces, including popups and on-page animations. I am additionally familiar with React and Tailwind CSS, which complement my overall understanding of modern web development. </p>

<p align="center"> On the backend, I have worked with C#, .NET, and ASP.NET Blazor; however, my strongest expertise lies in database technologies. I am highly proficient in MSSQL and T-SQL, with hands-on experience in designing database structures, creating stored procedures, and performing advanced data management tasks. </p>

<p align="center"> Since 2025, I have been actively developing my knowledge in cybersecurity, focusing on data protection and application security. Combined with my strong background in database management, this area represents my most confident and well-developed skill set. Cybersecurity and databases form the core of my technical strengths, supported by my broader programming experience.</p>
